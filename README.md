---

## Recommendation Logic

### Daily Workout Generation Algorithm

```
INPUT: user_profile, time_available, equipment_access, location, date

1. CHECK user history
   - Last 7 days of workouts
   - Identify overused modalities
   - Calculate recovery status

2. DETERMINE intensity prescription
   - Base on energy level input
   - Adjust for menstrual cycle phase (if tracked)
   - Factor sleep quality
   - Consider workout history load

3. FILTER available workout types
   - Match equipment constraints
   - Match location constraints
   - Match time constraints
   - Match experience level

4. SELECT optimal workout
   - Prioritize variety (don't repeat same modality 2 days in row)
   - Match intensity prescription
   - Consider user preferences (learned over time)

5. GENERATE workout details
   - Warm-up protocol (location-specific)
   - Main workout with modifications
   - Cool-down/stretch
   - Progression notes for next time

OUTPUT: Complete workout with timing, instructions, modifications
```

### Consecutive Day Programming

The engine ensures intelligent workout sequencing:

**Day 1: High-Intensity Intervals** → Day 2: Low-Intensity Steady State  
**Day 1: Lower Body Focus** → Day 2: Upper Body Focus  
**Day 1: Running** → Day 2: Swimming or Cycling (cross-training)  
**Day 1: Maximal Effort** → Day 2: Recovery or Rest

### Weekly Programming Patterns

**Beginner (3-4 days/week):**
- Day 1: Low-moderate steady state (20-30 min)
- Day 2: Rest or active recovery
- Day 3: Beginner interval introduction (15-20 min)
- Day 4: Rest
- Day 5: Fun modality (dance, sports, hiking)

**Intermediate (4-5 days/week):**
- Day 1: Interval training (20-30 min)
- Day 2: Steady state (30-45 min)
- Day 3: Cross-training or active recovery
- Day 4: Interval training (varied modality)
- Day 5: Long steady state (45-60 min)

**Advanced (5-6 days/week):**
- Day 1: High-intensity intervals
- Day 2: Moderate steady state
- Day 3: Tempo/threshold work
- Day 4: Active recovery
- Day 5: Sport-specific or long intervals
- Day 6: Long endurance
- Day 7: Rest

What is cardiovascular conditioning?

Cardiovascular conditioning is the process of improving your heart 
and lung efficiency through regular aerobic exercise. When you 
condition your cardiovascular system, your heart becomes stronger, 
pumping more blood with each beat, while your lungs become more 
efficient at oxygen exchange. Benefits include lower resting heart 
rate, improved endurance, better mood, and reduced risk of heart 
disease.
```

**Numbered Lists:**
```
How to start cardiovascular training (Beginner Guide):

1. Start with 10-15 minutes of low-intensity activity
2. Choose an activity you enjoy (walking, cycling, swimming)
3. Aim for 3 sessions per week initially
4. Gradually increase duration before intensity
5. Track your progress with resting heart rate
6. Add variety after 4-6 weeks of consistency
```
